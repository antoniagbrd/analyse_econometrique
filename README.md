# analyse_econometrique
'montalvo.pdf' is our replication of results from Jos√© G. Montalvo's 2011 article "Voting after the bombings : a natural experiment on the effect of terrorist attacks on democratic elections".

The preparation.R file corresponds to the preparation of the data prior to processing. 

The Figure2.R file is used to produce a graph showing the evolution of the average ratio, over all provinces, of votes for the Conservative party to votes for the Socialist party.

The Did_vf.R file is used to perform a difference-in-difference analysis. 

The grp_syn.R file allows to perform a counterfactual of the previous analysis, by creating a synthetic control group.
